# AI-simulated-annealing-algorithm-TSP
This repository contains programs using classical Machine Learning algorithms to Artificial Intelligence implemented from scratch and Solving traveling-salesman problem (TSP) using an goal-based AI agent.

This project is about finding a solution to the traveling-salesman problem (TSP) using a so called goal-based AI agent. The goal is to find a cycle (a roundtrip) which visits every city once, while traveling the minimal possible distance.

A search algorithm called Simulated Annealing search has been used, which is a algorithms from the family of local search algorithms.Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete
